Odin Project Recipes 
    This is my first project with TOP. I plan on showcasing everything I have learned thus far. This list consits of: creating a HTML homepage, using links to direct users to another page within the same site, paragraphs, headings, bolded text, emphasis text, images among other things. I will be using HTML as if 2/16/22 that is all I have learned.
